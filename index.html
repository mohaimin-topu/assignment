            <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>Hi, My Name is Abdullah Al Mohaimin and I live in Bangladesh. I am currently 21 years old. I have completed my hsc examination in 2020. I got gpa 5. Though people critisize us that we got autopass. As if we had something to do with this situation. In this pandemic. I am trying to utilize my time in this course. Hopefully I can be a good Web Developer in near future.Even though my mother is so much sick that I cried for her that something might happen to her. She is quitely sleeping behind me. So I can't do the work loudly.She is the biggest supporter of me. She does not say no to me.Whatever I want to do she always supports me and tells me to go ahead.</p>
